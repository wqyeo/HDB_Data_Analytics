# HDB_Data_Analytics

A small and simple University Project.

### Specification

Given two data-sets, `HDB Dataset - Feb` and `HDB Dataset - Jan`, figure out the best way to merge both datasets.

Then, with the merged datasets, create a visualization chart and draw up a simple conclusion/description.
You must at least come up with 4 different analysis and conclusions.
